# Task 1: Describe and plot a social network ####

## a) load the affective network (2400 affective w1.csv) and the gender data (2400 sex.csv) ####

affective = read.csv("2400_affective_w1.csv")
affective=as.matrix(affective[,-1])
rownames(affective)=colnames(affective)


sex = read.csv("2400_sex.csv")
id = sex[,1]
sex=as.matrix(sex[,-1])
rownames(sex)=id



## b) recode the affective network of wave 1 into a friendship networks. (Hint: the value +2 stands #### 
#       for friendship ties â€“ see the data description for details) 

# In order to recode the affective network into a friendship network we need to identify what are the friendship
# relationships (negative and possitive) and assign a weight to them representing the strength of their relationship
# Since the relationships vary from -2 to -1, we can assign different weights as follows:
# Let us fix person i and j, and denote the matrix of affection by A
#    - If 0<A[i,j]<A[j,i] (j is more affective towards i), then we assign an arrow from j to i.
#    - If A[i,j]<A[j,i]<0 (i hates more j), then we assign an arrow from i to j.
#    - If A[i,j]=A[j,i] (they think the same of each other) we assign an arrow both ways
#    - If A[i,j] = 0, then there is no realationship -> no arrow from i to j.
#    - 



# I will use a basic matrix for now, and change it later if its needed.
# Let us suppose that there is only friendship if there is a 2 in the matrix

friendship=affective
friendship[!friendship==2]=0
friendship[is.na(friendship)]=0
friendship[friendship==2]=1


# c) calculate basic network descriptives for this friendship network

# Network size (i.e., number of nodes):
ncol(friendship)
# Density: 
gden(friendship)
# average degree:
sum(friendship, na.rm = T)/dim(friendship)[1]   # how many ties each person has on average   
# reciprocity ratio:
grecip(friendship, measure = "dyadic.nonnull")
# gender composition in class
table(sex)
# count of same gender ties (i.e. both nodes have the same gender)
index_men=which(sex==1)
index_women=which(sex==2)
friendship_women=friendship[index_women,index_women]
friendship_men=friendship[index_men,index_men]

lower_women=friendship_women*lower.tri(friendship_women, diag = FALSE)

friendship_men

lower_men[upper.tri(friendship_men)]=NA
diag(lower_men)=NA
upper_men=friendship_men*upper.tri(friendship_men, diag = FALSE)
upper_men[lower.tri(friendship_men)]=NA
diag(upper_men)=NA
sum(lower_men==t(upper_men),na.rm=TRUE)



# Other meassure of your choice: Degree centrality
degree <- sna::degree(friendship, cmode = 'freeman') 
# freeman specifies the total of incoming and outgoing ties
max(degree) # using max(), we see the highest value
degree
degree == max(degree) 
which(degree == max(degree) )


# Briefly interpret the measures (where sensible)
